 * @brief  Framework for a "Threadpool". Therefore within this file the MBThreadPool, MBWorkerThread and MBFunctor
 * 		   classes are defined. The MBThreadpool shall be used to handle MBFunctor
 * 		   objects. These functors are handled by MBWorkerThreads.
 * 		   The inherit class has to define the abstract functions with own or external thread
 * 		   implementations (e.g. boost).
